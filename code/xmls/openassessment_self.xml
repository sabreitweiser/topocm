      <prompt>This is a self-assessment problem, and you should estimate how much you have done.

Please do not just give yourself points: the course grading policy does allow you to skip the simulations completely and still pass the course.

Consider this grade also a way to providing information to us. Are we going too fast? Are the tasks too hard?

If you didn't manage to get some part done, feel free to ask for advice in discussions.

In the text entry field just leave a link to your notebooks.

But there's also a much better use for them: go to the discussion below and share the notebooks also with your colleagues.</prompt>
